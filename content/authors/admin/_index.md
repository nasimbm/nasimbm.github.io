## About Me

I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Toronto working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca). I received my PhD  in computer science from York University under supervision of Prof. [Marin Litoiu](https://marinlitoiu.info.yorku.ca/). My research interests include self-adaptive network and service management. I investigate methods and mechanisms to engineer self-adaptive systems to ensure they maintain and improve their expected behaviour on their own. For more on my research, please see my publications.
